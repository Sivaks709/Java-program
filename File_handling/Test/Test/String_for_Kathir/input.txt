This program will read the file line by line and 
split each line into words. It will then check if the 
word to be found is in the current line. If it is, the 
program will print a message to the console and return. 
If the word is not found in the current line, the program will
continue to the next line. If the word is not found in the entire file, 
the program will print a message to the console stating that the word was not found.
